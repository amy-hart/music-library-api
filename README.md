## Music Library API

This project was completed during my time on a part-time coding bootcamp at Manchester Codes. I created a music library api using Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and Mongo DB. This API allows a users to create, read, write and update actions on artists, albums, and songs. Jest and httpMocks were used for unit testing.
